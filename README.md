# Display Password Drupal Module

The Show Password Drupal module enhances the login form by allowing users to reveal the password they've entered. This can be a helpful feature for users who want to double-check their password before submitting the form.

## Installation

1. Download the module files and place them in the `modules/custom/` directory of your Drupal installation.

2. Enable the "Display Password" module by navigating to the Extend page (`/admin/modules`) in your Drupal admin panel.

3. Check the box next to "Display Password" and click the "Install" button.

## Usage

Once the module is enabled, the "Show Password" feature will automatically be available on the login form. Users will see an eye icon next to the password field. By clicking on this icon, they can toggle between showing and hiding their password.

## Configuration

There are no specific configuration options for this module. It seamlessly integrates with the default Drupal login form.

## Compatibility

This module is designed for use with Drupal 9 and Drupal 10.
